jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms of
Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
provisions. NEUROGATE's failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of
any provision of these Terms will not be construed as a waiver of any provision
or right. No waiver of any of these Terms will be deemed a further or
continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition. NeuroGate
reserves the right to change this dispute resolution provision, but any such
changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the
amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of
any or all of your transactions with NeuroGate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into
an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the
entire agreement between you and NeuroGate and governs your use of the Service,
superseding any prior agreements between you and NeuroGate. You will not assign
the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in
whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior
written consent of NeuroGate. Any purported assignment or delegation by you
without the appropriate prior written consent of NeuroGate will be null and

competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties
nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms
of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full
force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade
